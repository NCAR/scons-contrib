SCons tool for perl5 scripts and modules
========================================

To use it, drop the `perl5` directory on the `site_scons/site_tools`
(from the root of your project).  You will then want something similar
to this on your SConscript file::

    env = Environment(PERL5LIB=[Dir('lib-perl5'])
    env.Tool('perl5')

We do not really do the parsing of dependencies ourselves, there's
perl modules for this.  We make use of the Module::ScanDeps perl
module to find our dependencies.
