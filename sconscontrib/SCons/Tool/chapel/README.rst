Chapel Tools for SCons
======================

Introduction
------------

`SCons <http://www.scons.org>`__ is a build framework originally for C,
C++, Fortran, and D builds. It has though a tools (think plugin)
architecture that allows tools to be built for other language builds.
This repository contains a tool for building Chapel programs using the
chpl command. Recently the Chapel team have introduced the Mason
builder. This tool needs updating to deal with that.
