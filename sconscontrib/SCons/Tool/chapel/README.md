# Chapel Tools for SCons

## Introduction

[SCons](http://www.scons.org) is a build framework originally for C, C++, Fortran, and D builds. It has
though a tools (think plugin) architecture that allows tools to be built for other language builds. This
repository contains a tool for building Chapel programs using the chpl command. Recently the
Chapel team have introduced the Mason builder. This tool needs updating to deal with that.
