# CSharp and Mono Tools for SCons

## Introduction

[SCons](http://www.scons.org) is a build framework originally for C, C++, Fortran, and D builds. It has
though a tools (think plugin) architecture that allows tools to be built for other language builds. This
repository contains two tools, one for C# and one for Mono â€“ Mono is an implementation of C#, but the
command structure is somewhat different.

The sources in this repository were originally taken from the SCons wiki where people had been putting
sources for tools such as this before the rise of Git, GitHub, Mercurial and BitBucket. This repository
represents the up to date mainline for these tools as noted on the SCons wiki.
